You can choose to build this layout in vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, or for _bonus points_ pick a JS framework of your choice: [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/), ect.

Don't worry too much about functionality - just focus on the layout and make it mobile friendly to the best of your ability.


## Getting Started

To get started create a FORK of this repo and make a new folder titled _firstname-lastname-code_ (this folder is where all your code will live).

You will need to hit this call: `https://ahalogy-fe-interview-server.herokuapp.com/influencers/8634` to load the sample influencer data. Images are not returned on this call however, and will have to be hard coded. You can use the story images found here: `/images/miranda-anderson/story-images` or if you're feeling adventurous you can pull in images from a fun api instead ([Dogs API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), [Mars API](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api), or another fun api of your choosing).

All other image files you will need are also located in the `/images` folder (this includes the influencer's profile image and social icons).

Use [PT Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans) as your font.

There is also a few example code html files that you can reference if needed.

Let anyone on the Cincinnati Quotient Product Team know if you have any questions.

**Happy Coding!!**

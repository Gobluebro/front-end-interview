You can choose to build this layout in vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, or for _bonus points_ pick a JS framework of your choice: [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/), ect.

Don't worry about any links or functionality - just focus on the layout and make it mobile friendly to the best of your ability.


## Getting Started

To get started create a FORK of this repo and make a new folder titled _firstname-lastname-code_ (this folder is where all your code will live).

All images you will need are located in the `/images` folder (this includes the influencer's profile image, story images, and social icons).

Use [PT Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans) as your font.
